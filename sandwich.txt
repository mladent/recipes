Take a bread and make several slices.
Take some ham from the fridge and make some slice of those too.
Check if you have any cheese, if yes then take also a few slices of these.
Any olives or cucumbers there? If yes great slice these too.

Take one slice of bread and put slices of above ingridients on it. Mix at will.
Put additional slice of bread on top.

You have it! It makes me wonder why it is called "Sandwich" and not "Slices"?!
As it seems a certain lord was involved in this...
